# Titter Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to show how we can implement a logistic regression model, deep learning techniques and ensembled approach and understand how to implement the theoretical concepts of data science onto a real-world problem. As sentiment analysis data is one of the most popular data to work with, this project shows how to read, pre-process, visualise and understand the data. The major steps involved in this project were as follows:

##### Data reading and pre-processing
##### Data visualization and analysis
##### Modelling
##### Evaluation
